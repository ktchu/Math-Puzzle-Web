## Powers of $(x+1)$ and Pascal's Triangle

Expand the following powers of $(x+1)$: $(x+1)^0$, $(x+1)^1$, $(x+1)^2$, $(x+1)^3$, and
$(x+1)^4$.

Write down the coefficients for each power as rows arranged like bowling pins.

The triangle you made is the top of famous triangle that has many names: Pascal's triangle,
Tartaglia's triangle in Italy, Meru-prastaara (Staircase of Mount Meru) in India,
Khayyam triangle in Iran, Yang Hui's triangle in China.

What patterns do you see that let figure out the numbers in next row from the numbers in
the previous row?

__Bonus__. Use the patterns you find to figure out the sixth row of the triangle. Check by
computing $(x+1)^5$.
