## Babylonian Multiplication

In Babylonian math, the multiplication table is 60 x 60 (that's 3,600 numbers to memorize!).
It's a lot easier to just remember the numbers on the diagonal (which are all perfect
squares), so the Babylonians used formulas based on squares of numbers (instead of products
of numbers).

To multiply numbers, one of the formulas that the Babylonians used to compute $a$ times $b$
was

$$
\frac{(a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2}{2}.
$$

Assuming $a > b$, draw a diagram using rectangles with sides $a$ and $b$ and squares of
various sizes to show why this formula works.

Another similar formula that the Babylonians used to compute $a$ times $b$ was

$$
\frac{(a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2}{4}.
$$

Draw a diagram that shows why this formula works.

__Bonus__. Show the same results using algebraic manipulations (instead of pictures).
