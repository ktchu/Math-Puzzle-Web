## In Search of Energy

In this puzzle, we will be answering the following question _without solving the
equations of motion_ (at least not directly).

*  If we drop a ball at rest from a height $H$, what is its velocity $v$ as it hits the
   ground?

### Potential Energy

The _gravitational potential energy_ gained by an object that starts at $h_i$ and ends at
height of $h_f$ is equal to

$$
\Delta U = -\int_{h_i}^{h_f} F_g dy,
$$

where $\Delta U$ is the change in the gravitational potential energy, $F_g$ is the
gravitational force on the object along its trajectory of motion. If we fix $h_i$ to be
a constant, then we can define a function

1. Assuming that an object has a mass $M$ and that gravitational acceleration is a
   constant $g$, derive a function $U(h)$ for the gravitational potential energy of the
   object.

__Bonus__

* Does it matter what value we pick for $h_i$? Explain.

### Kinetic Energy

2. Using Newton's equation of motion and the definition of potential energy, derive an
   equation that relates the change in the potential energy to the change a simple function
   of the speed (i.e., $|v|$) of the object _without solving the kinematics equations_.

### Putting it Together

3. If we drop a ball at rest from a height $H$, what is its velocity $v$ as it hits the
   ground?
