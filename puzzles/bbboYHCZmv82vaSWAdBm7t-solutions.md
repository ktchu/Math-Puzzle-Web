## Diagonals of Imperfect Rectangles [Solutions]

Observe that the quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral. Moreover, because
$\angle ABC$ and $\angle CDA$ are right angles, $AC$ is a diameter of the circle that
circumscribes quadrilateral $ABCD$. Since the diameter of any circle is at least as long
as any chord of the circle and $BD$ is a chord of the circle, $AC \ge BD$.
