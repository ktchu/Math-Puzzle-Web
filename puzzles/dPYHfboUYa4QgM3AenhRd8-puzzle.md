## Euler's Formula - "The Most Remarkable Formula in Mathematics"

_Euler's formula_

$$
e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x
$$

is an incredibly useful tool in mathematics, science, engineering, and beyond! For
instance, it is handy for deriving trigonometric identities, rotating objects in
space, understanding electrical circuits, explaining the behavior of light, and analyzing
sound patterns.

Use ideas from calculus to derive _Euler's formula_.
