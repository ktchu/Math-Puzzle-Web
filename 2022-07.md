## 1. Powers of $(x+1)$ and Pascal's Triangle

Expand the following powers of $(x+1)$: $(x+1)^0$, $(x+1)^1$, $(x+1)^2$, $(x+1)^3$, and
$(x+1)^4$.

Write down the coefficients for each power as rows arranged like bowling pins.

The triangle you made is the top of famous triangle that has many names: Pascal's triangle,
Tartaglia's triangle in Italy, Meru-prastaara (Staircase of Mount Meru) in India,
Khayyam triangle in Iran, Yang Hui's triangle in China.

What patterns do you see that let figure out the numbers in next row from the numbers in
the previous row?

__Bonus__. Use the patterns you find to figure out the sixth row of the triangle. Check by
computing $(x+1)^5$.

## 2. Babylonian Multiplication

In Babylonian math, the multiplication table is 60 x 60 (that's 3,600 numbers to memorize!).
It's a lot easier to just remember the numbers on the diagonal (which are all perfect
squares), so the Babylonians used formulas based on squares of numbers (instead of products
of numbers).

To multiply numbers, one of the formulas that the Babylonians used to compute $a$ times $b$
was

$$
\frac{(a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2}{2}.
$$

Assuming $a > b$, draw a diagram using rectangles with sides $a$ and $b$ and squares of
various sizes to show why this formula works.

Another similar formula that the Babylonians used to compute $a$ times $b$ was

$$
\frac{(a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2}{4}.
$$

Draw a diagram that shows why this formula works.

__Bonus__. Show the same results using algebraic manipulations (instead of pictures).

## 3. Friends of $\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)$

Suppose that we know that $\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right) = 3$. Without solving for $x$,
calculate the following quantities:

* $x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}$

* $x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3}$

* $x^4 + \frac{1}{x^4}$

* $x^5 + \frac{1}{x^5}$
