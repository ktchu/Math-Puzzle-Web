## Diagonals of Imperfect Rectangles

Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is an attempt at drawing a rectangle.

We have checked that $\angle ABC$ and $\angle CDA$ are right angles, but something still
looks a little off. It looks like $AC$ is longer than $BD$, and _indeed it is!_

Show that it will always be this way: no matter how badly we draw a rectangle, if one pair
of opposite corners are right angles, then the diagonal between right angles will never be
longer than the diagonal between the other pair of opposite corners.
