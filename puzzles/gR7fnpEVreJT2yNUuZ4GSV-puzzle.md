## Logarithms Never Win the Race to Infinity

No matter many powers of the logarithm function $\log(x)$ we take, in a race to $\infty$,
it will always be overtaken by the simple linear function $f(x) = x$. Show why this is this
so.

__Bonus__

1. Show that by $x = 1$, $f(x) = x$ winning the race and $\log^2(x)$ never catches up.

2. The larger $n$ is, the longer it takes for $f(x) = x$ to catch up to the large lead
   that $\log^n(x)$ gets earlier in the race. Let $x^*$ be the the crossover point where
   $f(x) = x$ catches up to $\log^n(x)$. Use a graphing calculator (or equivalent) to
   get a sense of how fast the crossover point grows with $n$.
