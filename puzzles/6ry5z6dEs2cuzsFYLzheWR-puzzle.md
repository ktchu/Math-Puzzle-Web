## Simpler Inequalities - Quadratics FTW

Inequalities are great for estimating the size of quantities of interest … but only if
they are simple enough.

### The Situation

Suppose we need to estimate the length $L$ of a ladder to buy in order to reach the top
of a building of height $h$ if we want the ladder to make an angle $\theta$ with the
ground.

To help us, we have a device that tells us $x$ when we set the movable arm to the desired
angle.

### How Long Does the Ladder Need to Be?

1. Show that the shortest possible length for the ladder (if it just barely reaches the
   corner of the building) is

   $$
   L_{min} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
   $$

2. For safety, we definitely want to buy a ladder with $L \ge L_{min}$. We don't need an
   exact answer, so it's _good enough_ to calculate an estimate that is always bigger than
   $L_{min}$ but _easier to calculate_ (for instance, it would be nice to not have to
   calculate the square root … especially if we don't have a calculator handy).

   Show that we can use simpler formula $(1 + x^2)$ to estimate the shortest ladder to buy.
   In other words, show that

   $$
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \le 1 + x^2.
   $$
